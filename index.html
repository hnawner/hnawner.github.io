            <p>
              Toward the end of my internship at Electronic Arts, I volunteered
              to write a short piece to be used as background music in the unannounced
              god-scale sandbox prototype from Maxis, the studio behind The Sims,
              on which I worked. The challenge here was mixing Maxis-style music,
              the style of sandbox game music, and my own flair in a track
              that would be engaging to the listener but not busy enough that
              it would detract the player's attention from the game itself. As
              an added challenge, it had to sound good using MIDI samples only -
              I wouldn't have access to live performers from CMU's music department
              until after I finished. The result is this light, slightly jazzy
              piece for stings, winds, and percussion.
              <br><br>
              Update (9/13/18): This piece was used in the demo video presented
              to Maxis at the all-studio meeting.

              This miniature was a personal challenge I gave myself to write in
              a post-modern style. Specifically, I wanted to get away from triads
              and key signatures typical of music before the 20<sup>th</sup>
              century. This pretty funky piece does just that - there's no
              real key, or root, to ground the music, and it avoids the types
              of chords that would give even the illusion of a key throughout.
              It was a challenge to write something so different from my other
              pieces, and it was a nice way to explore modern music.

              This piece was inspired by Richard Jones' poem
              <a href="http://www.ronnowpoetry.com/contents/jones/Bell.html"
                 target=_blank>
                 "The Bell",
              </a>
              written for and performed at the annual Poetry,
              Music, Art & Dance festival (more information
              <a href="http://www.williamsvillek12.org/departments/teaching_and_learning/music/poetry_music_art_and_dance_celebration.php"
                 target=_blank>here</a>, or below in the description for "Morning").
              I felt two distinct styles from this poem: melancholy contemplation,
              and the lighthearted fun of a sprawling imagination. While seprately
              the two main themes sound disjointed - the second feeling more in line
              with the Legend of Zelda than a somber poem - I was quite happy with
              its complete form.

              This piece, inspired by Dan Gerber's poem of the same name,
              was the first serious piece of music I composed. This was written
              for the Poetry, Music, Art & Dance festival, where a poet is brought in
              (some as noteworthy as the British
              poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy) to be the centerpiece of the show.
              Students are then encouraged to write music, choreograph dances,
              or create drawings, paintings, or sculptures based on the poems written
              by that year's guest.

              This is a project I started shortly before the school year started.
              I had sunk several hours (...dozens of hours...) into Rimworld,
              a colony simulator not unlike the 2006 game Dwarf Fortress, and wanted
              to try combining the real-time tactics mechanics of Rimworld combat
              with the strategic, methodical-yet-frantic gameplay of machine
              hunting in Horizon Zero Dawn.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately, I've little to show in my Github repository besides
            a pathfinding algorithm for the units, but I will be posting my design
            documentation soon. Stay tuned...
